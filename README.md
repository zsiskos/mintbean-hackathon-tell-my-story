# My First MintBean Hackathon: Use Data to Tell My Story
I particpated in my first hackathon, which had a smiple objective: In 4 hours, build a website that uses Google charts to tell my life story.

I had never used Google charts before and while they are quite easy to use, there's a lot of options. I also struggled a bit with getting the layout to function the way I wanted and had to abandon some ideas I spent time trying to figure out.

After voting, my site placed 2nd. I was pleased with the outcome but some of the issues I was struggling with were bugging me so I came back to the site and gave myself 4 hour to redesign it. The site currently hosts both versions for comparison.

## Changes
**Layout**
- I used CSS grid for the template. Once i figured out how I wanted it to look, using named template areas made it rediculously simple

**Used Firefox for development**
- I learned about a new (to me) feature in Firefox that shows your grid-area template in the dev tools

**Mobile first**
- I structured the layout for mobile first, then used media queries for tablet and desktop sizes

**Chart styling**
- I customized the chart colours to go with the scheme of the site. I also changed some of the layout feautres, such as moving the legend.

**Pseudo elements / Animation**
- I used pseudo elements and an animation in the nav button to display a fun hover feature

**Tided up**
- I cleaned up some of the code spacing and copy writing

##Further Learning
I recognize that I spend a lot of time fiddling with css becasue unit sizing is not intuatitive to me. I find myself adjusting and readjusting to great lengths before being happy with how something looks and there's a lot that can be adjusted! With more practice I'll be able to narrow down my choices and save a lot of time on design.

I also did not leave any time to figure out how to adjust the sizing of the chart to make it responsive. Currently, if you change the size of the site, things adjust but you need to refresh the page to get the chart to adjust accordingly.

Overall, I am really happy with what I learned and will continue to update the data in the chart.
